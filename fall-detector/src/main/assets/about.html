        Make sure to configure the emergency phone number for the app to call
        automatically when a fall is detected.
      </li>
      <li>Calls from that number will be answered automatically.</li>
      <li>
        An SMS from that number with the word POSITION in the content will be
        replied to automatically with the geographical position (if
        available).
      </li>
      <li>
        If the SMS contains the word ALARM instead, it will play back an alarm
        sound.
      </li>
      <li>The app will start automatically when the phone is turned on.</li>
      <li>
        For optimal performance (to reduce the number of false alarms and the
        number of undetected falls) carry the device close to your waist (a
        trouser pocket, a belt clip, etc.).
      </li>
      <li>Keep your device charged at all times.</li>
    </ul>

      The fall detection is based upon the algorithm number 2 described in
      <i>
        "Comparison of low-complexity fall detection algorithms for body
        attached accelerometers"</i>
      authored by Maarit Kangas, Antti Konttila, Per Lindgren, Ilkka Winblad,
